This project integrates the Gemini API into an Android application by creating a custom REST API using Python. The REST API is hosted locally and communicates with the Android app via Retrofit for seamless interaction and data exchange.

Features
Custom REST API: A Python-based REST API is built to interact with the Gemini API using JSON requests and responses.
Local Hosting: The Python server is hosted locally, providing an endpoint for the Android app to communicate with the Gemini API.
Android Integration: The Android app uses Retrofit to send requests to the locally hosted REST API and handle responses effectively.
Gemini API Integration: The custom REST API is responsible for processing and forwarding user requests to the Gemini API and returning the responses back to the Android app.
